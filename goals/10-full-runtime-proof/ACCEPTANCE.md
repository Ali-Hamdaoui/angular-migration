# Acceptance Contract — G10 Integrated Angular 18→21 Runtime Proof

Every criterion below is mandatory unless the authoritative backlog explicitly marks it conditional.

## S4-F15 — Prove the full Angular 18.x to approved 21.x MVP with fixtures, repair, cancel, and restart

### Exact feature acceptance criteria

- **Happy path:** Given all dependencies are complete and valid inputs are supplied, when the user completes the UI action for **Prove the full Angular 18.x to approved 21.x MVP with fixtures, repair, cancel, and restart**, then the backend performs only the authorized service operation, persists the result, emits the documented **Existing** durable events, and the UI displays the authoritative success state.
- **Invalid input:** Given malformed, unsupported, unsafe, or incomplete input, when the request is submitted, then FastAPI returns a stable machine-readable error, no illegal transition occurs, no unregistered artifact is trusted, and the UI displays a corrective blocked or failure state.
- **Stale state:** Given the aggregate state version changes after the page is loaded, when a mutating request uses the old version, then the backend returns `STALE_STATE_VERSION`, the UI reloads the snapshot, and the operation is not duplicated.
- **Persistence:** Given the operation succeeds, when the database is inspected through its repository/API, then the expected records for **Test execution metadata and complete migration-run records/artifacts.** exist with state version, timestamps, and idempotency lineage.
- **Evidence:** Given the feature produces evidence, when the step is shown as passed or completed, then **External fixture-generation manifests, repository-isolation evidence, external-output-layout evidence, automated integration results, real runtime proof report, cancellation/restart evidence, repair lineage, final output fingerprint, and external-source integrity proof.** is already finalized, SHA-256 registered, retrievable by artifact ID, and immutable.
- **Frontend behavior:** Given loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, backend-failure, and reconnect states, when each is simulated, then the UI renders a distinct user-readable state and never advances the workflow locally.
- **Backend failure:** Given the application service, database, filesystem, external process, or external provider fails, when the failure is returned, then partial evidence is preserved where safe, state remains legal, and the UI exposes a correlation ID and recovery guidance.

### Exact feature Definition of Done

- Backend application service and domain rules are complete and invoked through one authoritative path.
- Frontend surface is complete in the same sprint and reads authoritative APIs/events only.
- API request/response and stable error contracts are documented.
- Alembic migration exists and rollback/upgrade is tested when schema changes.
- Expected artifacts are finalized, checksum-registered, immutable, and accessible by ID.
- Durable events are committed after/with state and replay correctly when applicable.
- Unit, API integration, frontend component, SSE/event, security/integrity, and regression tests pass as relevant.
- The documented UI manual scenario passes, including at least one negative case.
- Loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, reconnecting, and failure states are visible as relevant.
- No architecture authority is bypassed and relevant design/API/testing documentation is updated.

## Capability closeout

- All Jira task review cycles pass.
- Frozen contract conformance tests pass.
- Automated and mandatory manual validation pass.
- As-built documentation passes.
- Both final audits pass.
- Shared/database changes are recorded.
- `branch_ready=true` before push.
- `integration_verified=true` only after integrated evidence.
