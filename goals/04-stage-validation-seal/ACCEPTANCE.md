# Acceptance Contract — G04 Stage Validation, G09, G12, and Copy-Forward

Every criterion below is mandatory unless the authoritative backlog explicitly marks it conditional.

## S3-F10 — Run final clean install and deterministic static checks

### Exact feature acceptance criteria

- **Happy path:** Given all dependencies are complete and valid inputs are supplied, when the user completes the UI action for **Run final clean install and deterministic static checks**, then the backend performs only the authorized service operation, persists the result, emits the documented **VALIDATION_FINAL_INSTALL_*** durable events, and the UI displays the authoritative success state.
- **Invalid input:** Given malformed, unsupported, unsafe, or incomplete input, when the request is submitted, then FastAPI returns a stable machine-readable error, no illegal transition occurs, no unregistered artifact is trusted, and the UI displays a corrective blocked or failure state.
- **Stale state:** Given the aggregate state version changes after the page is loaded, when a mutating request uses the old version, then the backend returns `STALE_STATE_VERSION`, the UI reloads the snapshot, and the operation is not duplicated.
- **Persistence:** Given the operation succeeds, when the database is inspected through its repository/API, then the expected records for **Validation step results, command records, diagnostics, artifact references.** exist with state version, timestamps, and idempotency lineage.
- **Evidence:** Given the feature produces evidence, when the step is shown as passed or completed, then **Final install logs/result, static diagnostic reports, exact dependency tree evidence, and validation summary fragment.** is already finalized, SHA-256 registered, retrievable by artifact ID, and immutable.
- **Frontend behavior:** Given loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, backend-failure, and reconnect states, when each is simulated, then the UI renders a distinct user-readable state and never advances the workflow locally.
- **Backend failure:** Given the application service, database, filesystem, external process, or external provider fails, when the failure is returned, then partial evidence is preserved where safe, state remains legal, and the UI exposes a correlation ID and recovery guidance.
- **Execution authority:** Given any attempt to bypass the registered command template, approved plan, exact profile, workspace alias, or `shell=false` policy, when authorization runs, then execution is rejected before process creation.

### Exact feature Definition of Done

- Backend application service and domain rules are complete and invoked through one authoritative path.
- Frontend surface is complete in the same sprint and reads authoritative APIs/events only.
- API request/response and stable error contracts are documented.
- Alembic migration exists and rollback/upgrade is tested when schema changes.
- Expected artifacts are finalized, checksum-registered, immutable, and accessible by ID.
- Durable events are committed after/with state and replay correctly when applicable.
- Unit, API integration, frontend component, SSE/event, security/integrity, and regression tests pass as relevant.
- The documented UI manual scenario passes, including at least one negative case.
- Loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, reconnecting, and failure states are visible as relevant.
- No architecture authority is bypassed and relevant design/API/testing documentation is updated.

## S3-F11 — Run and inspect the required stage build matrix

### Exact feature acceptance criteria

- **Happy path:** Given all dependencies are complete and valid inputs are supplied, when the user completes the UI action for **Run and inspect the required stage build matrix**, then the backend performs only the authorized service operation, persists the result, emits the documented **STAGE_BUILD_STARTED/TARGET_COMPLETED/COMPLETED/FAILED** durable events, and the UI displays the authoritative success state.
- **Invalid input:** Given malformed, unsupported, unsafe, or incomplete input, when the request is submitted, then FastAPI returns a stable machine-readable error, no illegal transition occurs, no unregistered artifact is trusted, and the UI displays a corrective blocked or failure state.

- **Persistence:** Given the operation succeeds, when the database is inspected through its repository/API, then the expected records for **Per-target statuses, command records, diagnostics, artifact references.** exist with state version, timestamps, and idempotency lineage.
- **Evidence:** Given the feature produces evidence, when the step is shown as passed or completed, then **Build matrix, full logs, compiler diagnostics, output manifest/budget evidence where configured.** is already finalized, SHA-256 registered, retrievable by artifact ID, and immutable.
- **Frontend behavior:** Given loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, backend-failure, and reconnect states, when each is simulated, then the UI renders a distinct user-readable state and never advances the workflow locally.
- **Backend failure:** Given the application service, database, filesystem, external process, or external provider fails, when the failure is returned, then partial evidence is preserved where safe, state remains legal, and the UI exposes a correlation ID and recovery guidance.

- **Persistence:** Given the operation succeeds, when the database is inspected through its repository/API, then the expected records for **Command results, comparison results, step statuses, diagnostics and artifacts.** exist with state version, timestamps, and idempotency lineage.
- **Evidence:** Given the feature produces evidence, when the step is shown as passed or completed, then **Full test/lint logs, structured results, baseline comparison, test-file change report, and known-failure delta.** is already finalized, SHA-256 registered, retrievable by artifact ID, and immutable.
- **Frontend behavior:** Given loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, backend-failure, and reconnect states, when each is simulated, then the UI renders a distinct user-readable state and never advances the workflow locally.

## S3-F13 — Compare parity evidence, display assurance, and decide G09 validation acceptance

### Exact feature acceptance criteria

- **Happy path:** Given all dependencies are complete and valid inputs are supplied, when the user completes the UI action for **Compare parity evidence, display assurance, and decide G09 validation acceptance**, then the backend performs only the authorized service operation, persists the result, emits the documented **PARITY_COMPARISON_COMPLETED** durable events, and the UI displays the authoritative success state.
- **Invalid input:** Given malformed, unsupported, unsafe, or incomplete input, when the request is submitted, then FastAPI returns a stable machine-readable error, no illegal transition occurs, no unregistered artifact is trusted, and the UI displays a corrective blocked or failure state.
- **Stale state:** Given the aggregate state version changes after the page is loaded, when a mutating request uses the old version, then the backend returns `STALE_STATE_VERSION`, the UI reloads the snapshot, and the operation is not duplicated.
- **Persistence:** Given the operation succeeds, when the database is inspected through its repository/API, then the expected records for **Assurance dimension records, comparison summaries, gate/decisions, events.** exist with state version, timestamps, and idempotency lineage.
- **Evidence:** Given the feature produces evidence, when the step is shown as passed or completed, then **Route comparison, backend-integration comparison, changed-risk rollup, parity checklist, assurance summary, and G09 package.** is already finalized, SHA-256 registered, retrievable by artifact ID, and immutable.
- **Frontend behavior:** Given loading, empty, running, success, blocked, stale, backend-failure, and reconnect states, when each is simulated, then the UI renders a distinct user-readable state and never advances the workflow locally.
- **Backend failure:** Given the application service, database, filesystem, external process, or external provider fails, when the failure is returned, then partial evidence is preserved where safe, state remains legal, and the UI exposes a correlation ID and recovery guidance.
- **Missing approval:** Given G09 is pending, rejected, modification-requested, expired, or stale, when the next protected transition is requested, then the Transition Service rejects progression.
- **Approval binding:** Given any bound artifact, plan version, state version, or workspace fingerprint changes, when an older G09 decision is replayed, then it is recorded as invalid/stale and cannot satisfy the active gate.
- **Technical truth:** Given a mandatory technical check is failed, when a human submits approval, then the failed check remains failed and progression follows the configured non-bypass policy.
